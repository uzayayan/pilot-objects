# Pilot Objects

This is the official documentation for the "Pilot Objects" Unity package.

## About the Package

The "Pilot Objects" provides a feature in Unity projects where users can click on an object, press the "Inject" button, or use the default shortcut key (Ctrl + E) to move the object in the scene view. This functionality is similar to the "Pilot Actors" feature in Unreal Engine.

Additionally, users can activate this feature by clicking on the camera. The camera highlights the parts of the scene view that it sees and allows users to use composition overlays and adjust various settings.
