# Pilot Objects

This is the official documentation for the "Pilot Objects" Unity package.

## About the Package

This package allows the scene view camera to be used as a mechanism for placing game objects. Simply inject into any desired game object, adjust the scene view to the desired position, and then release the game object. The position and rotation of the scene view camera will be used to determine the position and rotation of the specified game object. By the way, you can use this feature on any camera. During navigation with the camera, you can see the portions processed by the camera as safe zones in the scene view.
